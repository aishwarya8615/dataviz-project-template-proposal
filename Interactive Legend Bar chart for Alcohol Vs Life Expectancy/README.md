An Interactive Color Legend bar chart for [Life Expectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv).

This bar chart takes  required inputs from the data(like Alcohol Consumption, Life Expectancy and Year)  and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of an Interactive Color Legend using 'Year' as input. This scatter plot would help in determining  the relationship between Alcohol Consumption and Life Expectancy in various continents.

An interactive color legend scatter plot with Menu for [Life Expectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv).

This scatterplot takes  required inputs from the data(like Health Expenditure, GDP, Income Composition from resources,Adult Mortality, Measles, Life Expectancy and Continent)  and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of a dropdown. This scatter plot would help in finding the correlation between these various inputs using Continent as the color legend

Note:  I got some ideas about the interactive color legend from Prof. Curran's  [Interactive Color Legend](https://beta.vizhub.com/curran/8b699c4000704216a709adfeb38f2411?edit=files)

Life Expectancy Data:

Dataset Source: [Life Expectancy WHO Data](https://gist.github.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a) uses the scatter plot visualization using vega-lite-api.

This visualization plot shows the Life expectancy of people in various parts of the world based on the number of years of schooling over a period of 15 years.

The colors represent the various continents. Size of the circle, the average BMI and tooltip displays the countries in the world.


Analysis: 
We can see that Africa seems to be the continent with less education and Europe displaying maximum education.
We also see a linear relationship between schooling and life expectancy which seems to be fascinating.

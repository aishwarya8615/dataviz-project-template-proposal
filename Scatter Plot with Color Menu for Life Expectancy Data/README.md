A Scatter plot with Color Menu for [Life Expectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv).

This scatterplot takes all inputs from the data and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of a dropdown. There is an additional menu dropdown for choosing the color as well. The correlation between each of the input parameters can be observed with the help of this scatterplot.

Note:  This visualization project is a modification of the original [Scatter Plot with Menus](https://beta.vizhub.com/curran/5b64eac403f5482bbda164e24034f4d4) done by Prof.Curran

An interactive color legend scatter plot with Menu for [Life Expectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv) and its correlation with respect to Adult and infant Mortality.

This scatterplot takes  required inputs from the data(like Infant Deaths,Adult Mortality, Life Expectancy and Continent)  and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of a dropdown. This scatter plot would help in finding the correlation between these various inputs using Continent as the color legend.

Tooltip displays Life expectancy.

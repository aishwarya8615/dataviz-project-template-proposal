A polished scatter plot with menu's of [Life Epectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv).

This scatterplot takes 4 inputs from the data which are "Life Expectancy", "GDP", "Year" and "Schooling" and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of a dropdown. The relationship between each of these factors can be seen with the help of this.

Note: This polished scatterplot is originally forked from Prof Curran's work [Polished Scatter Plot with Menus](https://beta.vizhub.com/curran/e3f5f029b82f44a084d73806feafc577)

An interactive color legend Scatter plot  for  Health Expenditure Vs Life Expectancy using the [Life Expectancy Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aishwarya8615/89d9f36fc014dea62487f7347864d16a/raw/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv).

This scatterplot takes  required inputs from the data(like Health Expenditure, Life Expectancy and Continent)  and uses these as inputs to both X and Y axes with the help of a dropdown. This scatter plot would help in finding the correlation between life expectancy and healthcare expenditure inturn helping countries to improve the life span.It also uses "Continent" as an input for Color Legend.Hovering over this helps in viewing the correlation in each continent.

Note:  I got some ideas about the interactive color legend from Prof. Curran's  [Interactive Color Legend](https://beta.vizhub.com/curran/8b699c4000704216a709adfeb38f2411?edit=files)
